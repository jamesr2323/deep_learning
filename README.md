# Deep learning examples

This is a collection of examples of using deep learning to solve different types of problems. I am using it as a way of getting practical experience while I follow along with the (fantastic) http://course.fast.ai/ course and the deeplearning.ai Deep Learning specialisation https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning.

## Data sources

I'll use publicly available datasets so all the examples are reproducible.
