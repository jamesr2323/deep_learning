# Deep learning examples

This is a collection of examples of using deep learning to solve different types of problems. I am using it as a way of getting practical experience while I follow along with the (fantastic) http://course.fast.ai/ course and the deeplearning.ai Deep Learning specialisation https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning. I will update the examples with any new methods I discover of doing each type of task, so that hopefully the results will improve over time.

## Data sources

I'll use publicly available datasets so all the examples are reproducible.

## Examples

Here are all the examples and associated test results.

### Image Classification

Multi-label classification:
 - Seedlings dataset: 97.2% accuracy on the test set
